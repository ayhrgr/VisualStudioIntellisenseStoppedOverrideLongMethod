# VisualStudioIntellisenseStoppedOverrideLongMethod

When I try to override a very long virtual method in visual studio's intellisense, the method list appears for a moment and then disappears immediately.

This seems to happen when the virtual method cannot be displayed on a single screen, as suggested by intellesense.

This happens frequently when the font size of "Statement Completion" is increased, or when using a low-resolution display.
